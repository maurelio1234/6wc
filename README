This project was inspired by a twitter bot (look for @6wcbot) for 6 weeks challenges that run couple of times on the internet every year. I basically recorded my tweets and devloped this code so I can run 'x' weeks challenges against myself (look at tweets_6wcbot_r_a.csv) to keep me motivated. Let's see how it plays out. It stores my performance on a local CSV file so I can run future challenges with myself, leading to (hopefully) better performance.
